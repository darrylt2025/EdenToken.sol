Hi everyone, I'm new to smart contract development and would appreciate it if you could take a look at my EdenToken contract. 
I'm particularly concerned about security and would love to get your feedback on any potential vulnerabilities or areas for improvement.

"I've uploaded my smart contract to GitHub for review: https://github.com/darrylt2025/EdenToken.sol. Any feedback on gas optimization, s
ecurity best practices, or general code quality would be greatly appreciated. Learn more about edencoinharvest.com and what I'm trying to 
do. All are welcome to join Eden chat at https://discord.gg/THkBAbdQ thank  you, Darryl
